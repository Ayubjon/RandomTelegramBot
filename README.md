# RandomTelegramBot
It's my first telegram bot. When you start dialogue with bot you will get the message:
```
Hi, {Your Name}! My name is {Bot's Name}. I am a bot that was written for printing the random number in interval that you will write
```
Then an option:
```
🎲Write interval | 😁just speak
```
Mode '😁just speak' is not interesting, so if you click on '🎲Write interval' you will get guide:
```
Write the interval like a (number1-number2), example:
1-50
```
So you can enter your interval and get a random number in range [number1; number2]

I also added handling Exceptions
